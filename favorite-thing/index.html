    <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
    <h2>What are my favorite things about Eastside Prep?</h2>
    <p>As an Eastside Prep junior, school can be pretty difficult and stressful at times. Classes aren't always
        enjoyable and it can be hard to have fun. But there are some things I love about school that help me look
        forward to going each day.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Seeing my friends at school each day</li>
        <li>Eating lunch and talking with friends</li>
        <li>Playing volleyball after school</li>
        <li>Listening to music during free periods</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I would say volleyball is my favorite among this list. Even though volleyball only lasts one trimester, the
        friends I make and experiences I gain are among the most important, cherished memories I have.</p>

    <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.eastsideprep.org/" target="_blank">Eastside Prep website</a> to learn more about
        my school!</p>
    <p>I also enjoy some classes over others. For example, I tend to find literature more interesting than history, and
        even though I find math and physics difficult at times, once I understand what is going on, they can both be
        pretty fun! The same goes for Web and Spanish! I've found that when I grasp a good understanding in each of my
        classes, that school and learning can be much more fun.</p>
    <p>Here is my class schedule below!</p>
