    <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
    <h2>What are my favorite things about Eastside Prep?</h2>
    <p>As an Eastside Prep junior, school can be pretty difficult and stressful at times. Classes aren't always
        enjoyable and it can be hard to have fun. But there are some things I love about school that help me look
        forward to going each day.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Seeing my friends at school each day</li>
        <li>Eating lunch and talking with friends</li>
        <li>Playing volleyball after school</li>
        <li>Listening to music during free periods</li>
    </ol>
