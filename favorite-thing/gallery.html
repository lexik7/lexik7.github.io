            <p>My experience on Eastside Prep's Varsity Volleyball Team has been nothing but fun! My team is full of the
                most amazing, talented, goofy girls. Below are some photos from our practices and games this season, as
                well as some nostalgic moments from last year.</p>

                <div class="description">This photo is from our team sleepover last season. The rest of the team
                    surprised me, Abigail, Josie with our "freshman initiation". Our teammates Mia, Rhea, Tess,
                    Allie,
                    Ayezah, and Ella woke us up at 3am, led us blindfolded into the woods behind the house, and
                    ambushed
                    us with silly string and whipped cream. It was definitely a crazy night and quite the bonding
                    experience.
                    Even after the seniors all graduated, we
                    still have a groupchat with the nine of us called "Silly String". </div>
