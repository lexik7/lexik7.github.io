        <p>Here's EPS's Academic Details:
            The EPS program is intentionally focused on each student constructing their own knowledge and meaning, with
            the expectation that they become more self-directed in their learning over the course of their academic
            careers and lives.
        </p>
        <p>Three core pedagogical principles guide our thinking as we continually design, re-design, and evolve the
            student experience in each course in our academic program.
        </p>
        <p>Inquiry
            Together, students and teachers engage relevant questions, questions worth asking and answering, in each
            academic discipline and course.</p>
        <p>Experience
            Together, students and teachers actively participate in the essential habits of mind and methods of doing in
            each academic discipline and course.</p>
        <p>Integration
            Together, students and teachers identify and make connections between different academic disciplines, the
            world inside and outside of school, and connections between course topics and studentsâ€™ personal interests.
